         About me
     </h1>

     <p>
       I’m a full stack web developer living just outside of Utah’s tech hub, Lehi Utah. I started out in the biochemical field and ended up in business development for large scale corporation, Gohealth. 
        I’ve always had a passion for finding the right solution for the problem placed in front of me. 
        I ended up in business development when I was recruited by Stephen Opel (director of development) and placed under VP Bryan Summerhaze. 
        My aptitude for people and analytics is what offered me the privilege to work with such an amazing team. 
        I was able to communicate with our engineering team on UX issues pertaining to our up-and-coming company website. 
        This is where I decided to learn to code and where I found my love for programming, ever since then my initiative and goal was to get into programming. 
        I taught myself most of the basic concepts (DOM, Data Structures, Error Handling, REST API’s, etc.). 
        This led me to Devmountain, an accelerated programming course, to better my ability in delivering production ready code and get up speed on industry standard.  
        <br>
        Moving forward, I’ve been working as free lance for a few years now. I’ve built out a number of features for client websites such as Milo Global and smaller e-commerce sites from new business acquisition. I have been building a pipeline encompassing a mixture of backend and frontend jobs which has paid my way to full time freelance Software Engineer.
        <br>
        As a web developer, I find enjoyment in writing the best code for time and space complexity while maintaining industry standards. The fulfillment of watching a prototype mature and evolve into a fast, responsive, full-functioning app is something I believe will never go away.
