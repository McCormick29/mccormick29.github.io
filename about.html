         About me
     </h1>

     <p>
       I’m a full stack web developer living just outside of Utah’s tech hub. I started out in the biochemical field and ended up in business development for a large scale corporation, Gohealth. 
        I found myself in business development when I was recruited by the director of onboarding and development and placed under VP Bryan Summerhaze. 
        My aptitude for people and analytics is what gave me the privilege to work with such an amazing team. 
        I’ve always been one to enjoy the building process of each endeavor I have taken part in. 
        My science background gave me the ability to pay close attention to detail at a very deep level and makes me question: "is this the right answer to our problem or is it just a quick solution?" 
        I enjoy the building process, but also the way me and my team go through the steps of the build. 
        Programming and development has given me the best of both worlds; I get to watch the business grow while specifically contributing in a hands-on way.
        <br>
        Moving forward, I’ve been working as freelance developer for a couple years now. I’ve built out a number of features for client websites such as Milo Global and smaller e-commerce sites from new business acquisition. I've been able to build a pipeline encompassing a mixture of backend and frontend jobs, which has paid my way to full time freelance Software Engineer.
        <br>
        <br>
        As a web developer, I want to be a part of something bigger and take pride in what my company does day to day. My goal has bee,n and always will be, maintaining and producing quality work and being a reliable integral part of the team.
